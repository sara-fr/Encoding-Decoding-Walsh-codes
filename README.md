# Encoding-Decoding-Walsh-codes
Two programs written in C++ to allow communication between three processes using the encoding/decoding mechanism based on Walsh codes.
A Walsh code of length n = 2k is a set of perfectly orthogonal codewords that can be defined and generated by the rows of a 2k Ã— 2k Hadamard matrix.
